Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics and economics that deals with the study of strategic decision-making among multiple interdependent and rational decision-makers, known as "players," in situations where the outcome of a participant's choice depends on the choices of others.

Key components of game theory include:

1. **Players:** Individuals or entities making decisions in the context of the game.

2. **Strategies:** The various options or choices available to each player.

3. **Payoffs:** The rewards or outcomes associated with different combinations of strategies chosen by players.

4. **Rules:** The framework or set of rules that govern the game, outlining what actions are permissible and the sequence of play.

Games in game theory can be classified into different types, such as cooperative or non-cooperative games. Non-cooperative games, which are the most common focus of game theory, involve players making decisions independently and without the ability to negotiate or form binding agreements. These games are analyzed using concepts like Nash equilibrium, which is a situation in which each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players.

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic example in game theory. In this scenario, two suspects are arrested and placed in separate cells. Each has the option to either collude and betray the other or stay silent. The outcome depends on the combined decisions made by both suspects. If both remain silent, they receive a lesser sentence. However, if one betrays and the other remains silent, the silent one gets the heaviest sentence, and if both confess, they receive a moderately heavy sentence. The dilemma is that regardless of what the other person does, it is always better for an individual to confess, but if both confess, they both end up worse off than if they had both remained silent.

Game theory has applications in various fields such as economics, biology, political science, and computer science. It helps in understanding strategic decision-making, predicting outcomes, and finding optimal strategies in situations where the actions of others significantly impact the result. It's widely used in analyzing markets, competition, auctions, negotiations, and various real-life scenarios involving multiple decision-makers.
